# Developer notes

We need to add the following features:

1. subscribe to events from calls and client. 
2. modify client and call parameters if dev needs to (eg: dev mode ...).
3. more flexibility in how the widget is triggered (not just a call button id).
4. a mode where it doesn't have a modal, just an element that exists within the page.
5. incoming call handling (notification, accept/reject, trigger a call component with that call invite).

Current API for the call widget is lacking in a number of ways:

1. user details collection at start, and survey prompt at the end are hardcoded and inflexible
2. no proper way to hook into the lifecycle events of the client and the call.

and many more things that stem from not having a flexible API.


## New API proposal

### Modal use

```html
 <call-modal trigger="button-id" open="boolean">
    <call-context token="string" destination="string" audio="boolean" video="boolean" ... other params>
        <call-video/>
        <call-transcript-viewer/>
    </call-window>
 </call-modal>
```

1. the `<call-modal>` is optional. It just shows it's children in a modal context.
2. the `<call-context>` is the main component that contains the call logic. It sets up the client and provides
methods to dial, hangup etc.
3. the `<call-context>` also emits events relating to the call state.
4. children of `<call-context>` inherit the client and the call object.
