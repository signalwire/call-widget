# TODO 

### ~~23 mar~~

1. ~~The token is pulled from .env during build time. User should be able to set it in the `<c2c-widget>` tag.~~
2. ~~`<style>` is included within DOM elements as they come and go.
    They should however be injected to shadow DOM root `shadowRoot.appendChild(style);`. Perhaps a global StyleManager class
    that can be used to inject styles into the shadow DOM.~~
3. ~~The widget should be able to be used in a non-modal form. Perhaps a modal wrapper that's decoupled from the widget.~~
    ```html
    <!-- modal usage -->
    <c2c-modal trigger="callButton">
        <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton>"</c2c-widget>
    </c2c-modal>

    <!-- non-modal usage -->
    <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton></c2c-widget>
    ```
4. ~~which device is selected? mute/unmute ... and other device based things.~~

---

### ~~24 mar~~

1. ~~on mobile, user's video is not showing.~~
2. ~~on mobile, loading spinner is not centered vertically.~~
3. ~~on mobile, the drop-down for device selection is offset from buttons.~~
4. ~~Handle errors properly. This includes device errors, connection errors and errors from the Client.~~

---  

### ~~25 mar~~

1. ~~`<c2c-widget>`'s `callDetails` shouldn't be an stringified JSON? It should just be 3 attributes. Why would you ever pass a JSON string?~~
2. ~~on desktop safari, the user video is centered. This seems related to the user video stream not showing up on mobile.~~
3. ~~on mobile safari ,the up arrow is very scaled down~~
4. ~~textcontent replaces even the svg tail (?) in chat bubbles for some reason~~
5. ~~clean up stuff correctly on hangup, so the next load is fresh.~~
6. ~~there's a device timeout if you don't give permission within like 5 seconds. seems to be coming from the SDK. looks incredibly weird.~~ (about this, see [this](./Device#the-5-second-timeout-issue))

---

### ~~26 mar~~

1.  ~~Refactor device management code.~~

---

### ~~27 mar~~

1. ~~on safari no image.decode is working.~~
2. ~~on safar ios, video not showing cuz too small~~
3. ~~on mobile, aspect ratio is flipped when changing devices?~~

---

### ~~29 mar~~
1. ~~make sure the modal is large enough and properly responsive.~~
2. ~~write usage and other guides.~~


## Nice to haves:

I am taking notes of the nice to haves, but these won't be done until the basics are solid.

1. The widget should be able to be used in a non-modal form. Perhaps a modal wrapper that's decoupled from the widget.
    ```html
    <!-- modal usage -->
    <c2c-modal trigger="callButton">
        <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton>"</c2c-widget>
    </c2c-modal>

    <!-- non-modal usage -->
    <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton></c2c-widget>
    ```

2. `<c2c-widget>`'s `callDetails` shouldn't be an stringified JSON? It should just be 3 attributes. Why would you ever pass a JSON string?
3. Chat bubbles should type in word by word, instead of block by block. I have a working implementation, but it's fundamentally flawed. A more sophisticated implementation will be required.
